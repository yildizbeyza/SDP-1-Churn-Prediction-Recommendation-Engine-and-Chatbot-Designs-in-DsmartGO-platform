# Senior Design Project - 1 
# Churn-Prediction-Recommendation-Engine-and-Chatbot-Designs-in-DsmartGO-Platform 

## Overview
This project was developed to improve user retention and satisfaction in the video streaming industry. It includes three main parts:  
- A **churn prediction model** that identifies users likely to leave the platform.  
- A **personalized recommendation system** that suggests content based on viewing history.  
- A **chatbot interface** that helps users find content and interact naturally with the platform.  

These systems work together to support better customer experience and long-term engagement.

## Confidentiality Notice
This repository does not contain any source code or proprietary implementation details due to a confidentiality agreement with **D-Smart GO**.  
The project’s internal architecture, datasets, and deployment configurations are protected under this agreement and cannot be publicly shared.  

This repository therefore serves as a documentation and summary page for the project’s purpose, design, and outcomes rather than a technical implementation archive.
